# Password_Generator

A small Java-based programm to generate passwords with a varing lenght and the option to choose the inculded symbols(numbers/letters/special). 
There is also a possibilty to store the passwords, this feature is still under development.

This is a personal project I delveloped in Java for fun during a semster to test out some things and eventaully have a programm to gernerate and manage my passwords.

Uploaded all work I have done to Git on 11/20/2021 and then continued working on it inside this Repository.
